    <h1>Why Accessibility in Coding Matters</h1>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Accessibility refers to the ability of every person regardless of disability or condition to access something. In terms of the web, accessibility refers to the design of web products, devices, and services that accommodate people who experience disabilities. Making the web accessible has become increasingly important, as it has grown into a mass resource for many life aspects such as education, employment, health care, entertainment, and more. Providing equal access to these bodies of information falls to the web products themselves, and the developers behind them. These individuals serve as gatekeepers of information, as their work directly impacts the way such information is received and interpreted.</p>

        <p>Simply put, accessibility is good UX. The term ‘user experience’ embodies the experiences of all users, even those with impairments or disabilities. While consider such user groups as a minority, according to the Pew Internet Project, survey conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, Jan. 2011, 54% of adults living with a disability go online. Classifying such instances “edge cases” is an incorrect assumption and leads to poor user experience. </p>
            
        <p>Making web accessibility a priority does not have to amount to hours of extra work. It relies on developers making conscious decisions and thinking through their implications. Below we have compiled a list of web accessibility ‘best practices’ that accommodate potential users with disabilities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bestprac">
        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <h3>1. Semantically correct HTML structure</h3>
        <p>While it is human tendency to scan pages of information for the sections we are interested in, people that require screen readers to access information online are unable to know which areas of a document to jump to. Using the appropriate HTML tags on content helps orient screen reader users on the page. As screen readers utilize HTML tags to navigate through a page, misuse of these tags can cause users a lot of confusion and frustration. 
        </p>

        <h3>2. Aria Labels</h3>
        <p>ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a set of HTML attributes that define ways to make web content and applications more accessible to people with disabilities. Assigning ARIA attributes to HTML tags provides a range of functionality to disabled users such as describing a form or specifying active/inactive states for objects or buttons.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Tab Index</h3>
        <p>Total web accessibility suggests that all functionality of product or service could be carried out using a keyboard. Users should be able to tab through all of the content of a page and even be able to jump to a page’s main content when they arrive on the page. This can be achieved by creating a hidden hyperlink in the beginning of the page that links to the main content. 
        </p>

        <h3>4. Color Use</h3>
        <p>Color blindness affects close to 10% of the population. This means that designers and developers should not rely solely on color to indicate meaning or importance. Using accessibility tools that can display the page from the perspective of visually impaired users can serve as a check for color use.</p>
    
        <h3>5. Alt Tags</h3>
        <p>alt tags should always accompany images, as they provide users with text that describes the corresponding image. It is helpful to be as descriptive as possible, so that screen reader users can understand what purpose the image is serving. 
        </p>

        <h3>6. Text Clarity</h3>
        <p>Text clarity can is something that many people suffer with, which is why designers should prioritize legibility and readability of content. This includes careful consideration of font size, space, color contrast in relation to elements around the text. </p>
    
        <h3>7. Accessibility checkers</h3>
        <p>As web accessibility has become more important, many tools have been built to help designers and developers empathize with disabled users and highlight accessibility issues in their code. Popular checkers include WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool), W3C, and Axe, which quickly run through your page and summarize any errors and inform you of what the best practice for coding would be in a given scenario.
        </p>

        <p>While this list does not ensure complete web accessibility on one’s site, it represents major areas of concern that can be directly mitigated or reduced. We hope this  information leaves you with an enriched understanding of why accessibility matters and the steps you can take to do your part!
